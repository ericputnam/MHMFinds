- Night: Scrolling TikTok, watching "dorm room makeover" videos
- Weekend: Studying, occasionally shopping at Target with friends

- TikTok: Primary platform (watches "Amazon finds", "dorm hauls")
- Instagram: Scrolling, rarely posts
- Pinterest: Dorm room inspiration boards
- YouTube: Study with me videos, budget content

4. **Social Proof:** "Did I see this on TikTok? Is it viral?"
