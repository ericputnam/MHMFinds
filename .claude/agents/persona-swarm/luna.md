5. Price vs. quality trade-offs in search results

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Finding Quality Goth Makeup
Luna searches for dark lipstick and dramatic eye makeup. She expects to find high-quality options and be able to filter by creator reputation.

### Scenario 2: Building a Gothic Victorian Home
Luna needs furniture, decor, and build items for a Victorian gothic mansion. She wants cohesive pieces from creators who specialize in this aesthetic.

### Scenario 3: Monthly Curated Purchase
With her 20 USD budget, Luna wants to find the single best quality item that matches her style perfectly, even if it takes browsing multiple sessions.

### Scenario 4: Discovering New Creators
Luna wants to find creators who specialize in alternative/goth content that she has not discovered yet.

## Simulated Feedback Examples

### Positive Feedback
Finally! A creator who understands that goth makeup needs to be more than just black lipstick. The detail on these eyeshadow swatches is incredible - you can see the individual pigment particles. Worth every penny.

### Negative Feedback
Why is this tagged as goth? It is just a black version of a basic dress. There is nothing about the silhouette, texture, or detailing that reads as alternative. Please improve your tagging system.

### Feature Request
I would love to be able to filter by aesthetic rather than just category. I do not care if something is a dress or a top - I care that it fits my dark romantic vibe.

## Metrics to Track
- Search-to-download conversion rate for goth/alternative content
- Time spent browsing vs. downloading (quality research behavior)
- Review submission rate (engaged users like Luna review more)
- Return visit frequency
- Average transaction value (should be moderate but consistent)
