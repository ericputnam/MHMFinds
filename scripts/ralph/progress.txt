## Codebase Patterns

### Database
- Prisma client: import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma'
- Run scripts with: npx tsx scripts/your-script.ts
- Mod facet fields: contentType, visualStyle, themes[], ageGroups[], genderOptions[], occultTypes[], packRequirements[]

### Clothing-related contentTypes (for gender logic)
- CAS items that CAN have gender: hair, tops, bottoms, dresses, full-body, shoes, accessories, jewelry, makeup, skin, eyes, nails, tattoos, glasses, hats
- Items that should NOT have gender: furniture, lighting, decor, clutter, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, outdoor, plants, rugs, curtains, electronics, poses, animations, gameplay-mod, script-mod, trait, career, food, lot, ui-preset, cas-background, loading-screen

### Visual Styles
- alpha: realistic/high quality CC
- maxis-match: matches EA art style
- semi-maxis: between alpha and MM
- clayified: smooth clay-like textures
- realistic: photorealistic

### Script patterns
- Always disconnect prisma at end: await prisma.$disconnect()
- Use batch updates for performance: prisma.mod.updateMany()
- Log progress with counts for verification

### TypeScript
- Run type-check: npm run type-check
- Scripts go in /scripts directory
- Use @/ path alias for imports

### UI Verification (Playwright)
- Take screenshots: npm run screenshot / [filename]
- Mobile screenshot: npm run screenshot / homepage --mobile
- Full page: npm run screenshot / --full
- Wait for element: npm run screenshot / --wait=".mod-grid"
- Screenshots saved to: scripts/ralph/screenshots/
- Dev server must be running: npm run dev (in another terminal)
- Import in scripts: import { takeScreenshot } from './screenshot'

  - Description exact word: +15 points
  - Description partial: +5 points
