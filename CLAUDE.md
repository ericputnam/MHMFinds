# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🔐 CRITICAL SECURITY RULE: Never Commit Secrets

**NEVER commit any of the following to git:**

### Prohibited Items:
- ❌ API keys, tokens, or secrets of any kind
- ❌ Database connection strings with credentials
- ❌ Passwords, auth tokens, or session secrets
- ❌ Private keys, certificates, or encryption keys
- ❌ OAuth client secrets
- ❌ Webhook secrets
- ❌ Any `.env*` files except `.env.example`

### Required Actions:
1. **Use placeholders in documentation**: Replace actual credentials with `[YOUR_KEY_HERE]` or `your-key-here`
2. **Check `.gitignore`**: Ensure all sensitive files are ignored:
   ```
   .env
   .env.local
   .env*.local
   .env.production
   *.key
   *.pem
   secrets/
   ```
3. **Use `.env.example`**: Only commit example files with placeholders, never actual values
4. **Before committing**: Always review changes for exposed credentials
5. **If exposed**: Immediately rotate credentials and remove from git history

### Safe Patterns:
✅ `.env.example` with placeholders
✅ Documentation with `[PLACEHOLDER]` values
✅ Instructions to "copy from .env.local"
✅ Links to credential providers (e.g., "Get from Stripe Dashboard")

**If you accidentally commit secrets, STOP immediately and rotate the credentials before continuing.**

## 🚫 CRITICAL GIT RULE: Never Auto-Commit

**NEVER create git commits unless explicitly requested by the user.**

### Prohibited Actions:
- ❌ Automatically committing changes after completing a task
- ❌ Creating commits "to save progress" without being asked
- ❌ Committing changes as part of a larger workflow unless specifically instructed
- ❌ Suggesting or offering to commit changes (just wait for user request)

### When You CAN Commit:
✅ User explicitly says: "commit my changes", "create a commit", "make a git commit", etc.
✅ User asks you to "commit and push"
✅ User requests a commit as part of a specific workflow they describe

### Rationale:
Users want full control over what gets committed and when. Even if you complete a feature successfully, the user may:
- Want to review changes first
- Need to make additional modifications
- Prefer to commit manually with their own message
- Be working on a larger change set that includes your work

**IMPORTANT: Only commit when the user explicitly asks you to commit. No exceptions.**

## IMPORTANT: newapp_musthavemods Folder

**The `/newapp_musthavemods` folder is a DESIGN REFERENCE ONLY.**

- This folder contains a Vite/React proof-of-concept app showing the desired look and feel for UI components
- **DO NOT** migrate the main Next.js app to use this Vite app
- **DO NOT** try to run or start the newapp_musthavemods dev server
- **INSTEAD**: Look at the component designs (ModDetailsModal, ModCard, etc.) in newapp_musthavemods as inspiration and apply the same visual design to the main Next.js app components
- Keep all existing backend functionality (PostgreSQL, Prisma, Next.js API routes)
- Only adopt the UI/UX patterns, styling, and layout from newapp_musthavemods

**Main development should ALWAYS happen in the root Next.js project, not in newapp_musthavemods.**

## Project Overview

ModVault (MHMFinds) is a Sims mod discovery platform built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The platform aggregates content from multiple sources (CurseForge, Patreon, Tumblr, etc.) and uses AI-powered search with OpenAI embeddings for semantic mod discovery.

## Development Commands

### Core Development
```bash
npm run dev                 # Start Next.js development server (localhost:3000)
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run start              # Start production server
npm run lint               # Run Next.js linter
npm run type-check         # TypeScript type checking without emitting files
```

### Database Operations
```bash
npm run db:generate        # Generate Prisma client from schema
npm run db:push            # Push schema changes to database (no migration)
npm run db:migrate         # Create and apply migration
npm run db:studio          # Open Prisma Studio GUI
npm run db:seed            # Initialize database with seed data
npm run db:reset           # Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data)
npm run db:deploy          # Apply migrations in production
```

### Content Aggregation
```bash
npm run content:aggregate      # Run standard content aggregation
npm run content:privacy        # Run privacy-enhanced aggregation (default settings)
npm run content:stealth        # Run stealth mode aggregation (max privacy)
npm run content:conservative   # Run conservative aggregation (slowest, safest)
npm run content:test           # Test privacy aggregator without database writes
```

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

**`/app`** - Next.js 14 App Router structure
- `/api` - API routes (REST endpoints)
  - `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` - NextAuth.js authentication handler
  - `/api/mods` - Mod CRUD endpoints
- `/mods/[id]` - Dynamic mod detail pages
- Multiple test pages for development (test/, working-test/, simple-main/, etc.)

**`/lib`** - Core business logic and utilities
- `/services` - Service layer containing business logic
  - `contentAggregator.ts` - Standard web scraping service for CurseForge, Patreon
  - `privacyAggregator.ts` - Privacy-enhanced scraping with proxy support, user agent rotation, and anti-detection features
  - `aiSearch.ts` - OpenAI-powered semantic search, recommendations, and mod similarity
- `/config` - Configuration files
  - `privacy.ts` - Privacy settings for content aggregation (default/stealth/conservative modes)
- `prisma.ts` - Prisma client singleton instance
- `api.ts` - API client utilities

**`/components`** - React components (landing page components: Hero, Features, ModCard, SearchBar, etc.)

**`/prisma`** - Database schema and migrations
- `schema.prisma` - Prisma schema defining all models

**`/scripts`** - Standalone utility scripts for database initialization and content aggregation

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT strategy, Google and Discord OAuth providers. User sessions stored in PostgreSQL via Prisma adapter.

**Database**: PostgreSQL accessed through Prisma ORM. All models use `cuid()` IDs. Key models:
- `User` - User accounts with creator/premium/admin flags
- `Mod` - Central mod entity with rich metadata, creator relations, and search index
- `CreatorProfile` - Creator profiles linked to users
- `SearchIndex` - Stores OpenAI embeddings (Float[]) and full-text vectors for AI search
- `ContentSource` and `ScrapingJob` - Track content aggregation sources and jobs

**Content Aggregation**: Two aggregator implementations:
1. `contentAggregator.ts` - Basic scraping with cheerio/axios
2. `privacyAggregator.ts` - Advanced scraping with proxy rotation, user agent spoofing, request timing randomization, and session management

**AI Search**: OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) stored in SearchIndex.embedding field. AISearchService provides:
- Semantic search with cosine similarity
- User-personalized recommendations based on favorites/downloads
- Similar mod discovery
- Popularity boosting in ranking algorithm

**Path Aliases**: TypeScript configured with `@/*` pointing to project root (see tsconfig.json)

## Recent UI/UX Enhancements

### Modern Search Experience (Latest Update)
The main search page (`app/page.tsx`) has been completely redesigned with enterprise-grade UX:

**Enhanced Search Bar:**
- Autocomplete dropdown with recent searches (localStorage persistence)
- Trending search suggestions with categorization
- Keyboard shortcuts (⌘K to focus search)
- Escape key to close suggestions
- Smart suggestions based on user input

**Smart Filter Sidebar:**
- Visual filter counts showing number of mods per category
- Custom-styled checkboxes with smooth transitions
- Individual "Clear" buttons for each filter section
- Gradient backgrounds for active filters
- Sticky positioning for persistent access during scroll
- Collapsible on mobile devices

**Quick Filter Tags:**
- One-click filters: Trending (most downloads), Newest, Top Rated, Free Mods
- Visual active states with gradients and animations
- "Clear All" button when filters are active
- Pulse animations on active tags

**Flexible View Options:**
- Grid view with 3, 4, or 5 column density options
- List view mode (UI ready, display logic pending)
- View mode toggle buttons with visual feedback
- Responsive grid that adapts to screen size

**Active Filter Pills:**
- Visual chips showing currently applied filters
- Individual remove buttons on each pill
- Color-coded by filter type (category, version, price)
- Displayed in results header for quick reference

**UI Polish:**
- Sticky header that stays visible during scroll
- Smooth fade-in animations for cards
- Gradient text effects on headings
- Hover states with scale transforms
- Loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Enhanced typography and spacing

**Custom Animations (globals.css):**
- `animate-fade-in` - Cards fade in on load
- `animate-gradient` - Animated gradient text
- `animate-pulse` - Subtle pulse on indicators
- Hover scale effects on interactive elements

### Implementation Files Modified
- `app/page.tsx` - Complete redesign of search page
- `app/globals.css` - Added custom animations and utility classes
- `components/ModCard.tsx` - Already well-designed, no changes needed
- `components/ModGrid.tsx` - Already supports dynamic grid columns

## Important Implementation Notes

### Content Scraping Privacy Levels
When scraping content, choose the appropriate privacy level:
- **Default** (`content:privacy`): 3-8s delays, user agent rotation
- **Stealth** (`content:stealth`): 5-15s delays, proxy rotation enabled, geographic rotation
- **Conservative** (`content:conservative`): 10-30s delays, strictest rate limiting

The privacy aggregator includes anti-detection features like randomized headers, rotating user agents, and session management to avoid blocking.

### Database Schema Considerations
- Mod prices use `Decimal(10,2)` - handle with Prisma's Decimal type
- SearchIndex.embedding is `Float[]` - store OpenAI embeddings here
- All cascade deletes are configured (User deletion cascades to all related entities)
- Unique constraints on favorites, reviews, and collection items prevent duplicates

### AI Search Implementation
The AISearchService generates embeddings on-demand (no pre-computed cache). For performance:
- Embeddings are generated for each search query
- Results are filtered before embedding calculation (limit * 2)
- Cosine similarity is calculated in-memory
- Popularity boost formula: `log10((downloads + 1) * (favorites + 1) * (rating || 1)) * 0.1`

### NextAuth Configuration
NextAuth uses JWT strategy (not database sessions). Custom callbacks populate JWT with user metadata (isCreator, isPremium, isAdmin). On user creation, a default "Favorites" collection is automatically created via event handler.

### Image Domains
Approved image domains in next.config.js: The Sims Resource, SimsDom, Sims4Studio, Patreon CDN, CurseForge, Tumblr, Unsplash, Placeholder. Add new domains to `images.domains` array before using them.

## Environment Variables

Required for development (see env.example):
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - NextAuth.js secret for JWT signing
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Application URL (http://localhost:3000 in dev)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for AI search features
- `CURSEFORGE_API_KEY` - Required for CurseForge content aggregation
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` - For Google OAuth
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` - For Discord OAuth

Optional but mentioned in env.example:
- Redis, Elasticsearch, AWS S3, SendGrid (not currently implemented)
- `PRIVACY_LEVEL` - Set to "stealth" or "conservative" for content aggregation

## Testing and Development

Multiple test pages exist in `/app` for rapid UI prototyping. These should be consolidated or removed before production deployment.

When adding new mods via aggregation, call `aiSearchService.updateSearchIndex(modId)` to generate embeddings for AI search functionality.

Database can be reset with `npm run db:reset` - this will delete all data and re-run migrations and seeds.
